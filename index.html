<h1>libtemplate.js - Template for JS libraries designed to work with GitHub Pages and Jekyll</h1>
<p>libtemplate.js makes it easier to start writing JavaScript libraries. It has been
designed to be used with GitHub (and GitHub pages). In addition it uses Grunt
as a build system.

</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>git clone git@github.com:bebraw/libtemplate.js.git mylib</li>
<li>cd mylib</li>
<li>rm -rf .git</li>
<li>git init</li>
<li>git add .</li>
<li>git commit</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see this workflow loses the version history and gives you a blank
slate to get started with.

</p>
<p>After you have done that <code>npm install</code> the dependencies. In addition you will
need to set up <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and
<a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> in case you wish to use syntax highlighting.

</p>
<p>Now that everything should be set up, invoke <code>grunt</code>. You should have a nice,
interactive development server running. Surf to <code>localhost:4000</code> at your browser.
If you have <a href="http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-">set up LiveReload 
extension</a>
the changes you make to the project <code>_meta</code> data should cause the browser
window to refresh automatically. This allows you to prototype your project
README.md and site in a quick manner.

</p>
<p>As you can see modifying <code>_meta/_README.md</code> causes the changes to propagate to
the project index. The same goes for modifications made to <code>_config.yml</code>. These
changes propagate to README.md, project index and package information. This
eases project development somewhat as you have the project metadata in a single
place and you don&#39;t have to worry about keeping separate files up to date.

</p>
<h2>Other Features</h2>
<p>Besides the basic <code>grunt</code> functionality, there are various helpers around. I&#39;ve
listed these in the following list:

</p>
<ul>
<li><code>grunt refresh</code> updates project files based on metadata. Handy if you just
want to make some quick change.</li>
<li><code>scripts/tag.js</code> sets git tag to current commit based on version at metadata
(<code>_config.yml</code>).</li>
<li><code>scripts/pu.sh</code> pushes the current changes to GitHub. In addition it pushes
the contents of the master branch to gh-pages so the index shows up properly at
GitHub Pages. It also pushes your tags to GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2>_config.yml Fields</h2>
<p>As there are quite a few fields at <code>_config.yml</code>, I&#39;ve listed their
descriptions below. You can easily add custom fields to the file and refer to
them at <code>_meta</code>. Simply do this using <code>field_name</code> syntax. These fields
are also available at Jekyll. There you can access them via <code>site.field_name</code>.

</p>
<ul>
<li><code>project_base</code> refers to the project name without a possible suffix (such as .js)</li>
<li><code>project</code> is meant to contain that</li>
<li><code>description</code> contains a brief (80-100) description of your project. This is
something you would use as your GitHub project description.</li>
<li><code>nick</code> is the nickname you use at GitHub (github.com/&lt;nick&gt;)</li>
<li><code>author</code> is your full name as an author. You may alternatively use multiple
authors if you want to.</li>
<li><code>license</code> is the license of your project. You may alternatively use multiple
if you want to.</li>
<li><code>version</code> refers to the version number of your library.</li>
<li><code>jquery</code> refers to version of jQuery to load. If it is empty, it won&#39;t
be loaded at all in the demo.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Example</h2>
<p>This bit is here just to illustrate how Pygments works. The example will render
with syntax highlighting on both README.md and GitHub Pages index.

</p>
{% highlight js %}
var a = 4;

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
{% endhighlight %}
